# How-to-compute-distances-of-bidimensional-points-NumPy-native-way
This is a NumPy-native way to compute distances on a 2D NumPy array

In this code I developed a totally NumPy-based way to compute distances in a bidimensional array. The only other library that I used is matplotlib to plot charts.
To develop this code I didn't use a table (.csv like or others) but I created a random array. The array support integer numbers but with a simple editing you can use floating points. Number of rows is deliberately low to make output visualization clearer.
The main idea behind this exercise is to use the distance between one point to the others to make broadcasting and compute distances among every point.
